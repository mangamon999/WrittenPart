@article{ye04,
	Abstract = {{This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.}},

	Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are appealing to researchers due to their
	wide range of application potential in areas such as target detection
	and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring,
	and tactical systems. However, low sensing ranges result in dense
	networks and thus it becomes necessary to achieve an efficient medium-access
	protocol subject to power constraints. Various medium-access control
	(MAC) protocols with different objectives have been proposed for
	wireless sensor networks. In this article, we first outline the sensor
	network properties that are crucial for the design of MAC layer protocols.
	Then, we describe several MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks,
	emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we point out
	open research issues with regard to MAC layer design.},
