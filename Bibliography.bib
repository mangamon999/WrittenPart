  abstract = {The availability of low-cost hardware such as CMOS cameras and microphones
	has fostered the development of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks
	(WMSNs), i.e., networks of wirelessly interconnected devices that
	are able to ubiquitously retrieve multimedia content such as video
	and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data from the
	environment. In this paper, the state of the art in algorithms, protocols,
	and hardware for wireless multimedia sensor networks is surveyed,
	and open research issues are discussed in detail. Architectures for
	WMSNs are explored, along with their advantages and drawbacks. Currently
	off-the-shelf hardware as well as available research prototypes for
	WMSNs are listed and classified. Existing solutions and open research
	issues at the application, transport, network, link, and physical
	layers of the communication protocol stack are investigated, along
	with possible cross-layer synergies and optimizations.},

	Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks
	are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security,
	habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical
	challenges in sensor network development include network discovery,
	control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing,
	tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting
	some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including
	localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking
	in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using

  abstract = {{This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol
	designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use
	battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these
	devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental
	monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc
	fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but
	becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics
	of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different
	from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways:
	energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while
	per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few
	novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration.
	It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes
	form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control
	overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel
	signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC
	applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications
	that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement
	results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley
	Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput.
	Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared
	with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.}},
