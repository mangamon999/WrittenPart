  abstract = {The advancement in wireless communications and electronics has enabled
	the development of low-cost sensor networks. The sensor networks
	can be used for various application areas (e.g., health, military,
	home). For different application areas, there are different technical
	issues that researchers are currently resolving. The current state
	of the art of sensor networks is captured in this article, where
	solutions are discussed under their related protocol stack layer
	sections. This article also points out the open research issues and
	intends to spark new interests and developments in this field.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are appealing to researchers due to their
	wide range of application potential in areas such as target detection
	and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring,
	and tactical systems. However, low sensing ranges result in dense
	networks and thus it becomes necessary to achieve an efficient medium-access
	protocol subject to power constraints. Various medium-access control
	(MAC) protocols with different objectives have been proposed for
	wireless sensor networks. In this article, we first outline the sensor
	network properties that are crucial for the design of MAC layer protocols.
	Then, we describe several MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks,
	emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we point out
	open research issues with regard to MAC layer design.},
